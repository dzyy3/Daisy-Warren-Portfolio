# 🎨 Plein Air Club Quiz — Community Art Tool

Welcome to the **Plein Air Club Quiz**, a playful and thoughtful web-based tool designed to help students reconnect with their artistic selves and explore new drawing experiences with the support of the Plein Air Club at The New School.

## ✨ Project Overview

The Plein Air Club Quiz is an interactive resource designed to help students figure out where, how, and **why** they might want to go out and draw. As a club focused on making plein air (outdoor) art more accessible, we provide materials, transit, and snacks — so this quiz is meant to remove barriers and spark inspiration.

The main inspo for this sight is how busy students at TNS are and how sometimes that means forgetting something once enjoyed.

## 🧠 Design Process

This quiz follows a **progressive narrative structure**:
1. **Stage 1** – “Do you like to draw?”
2. **Stage 2** – “Do you know where/how to draw?”
3. **Stage 3** – “When was the last time you enjoyed it?”
4. **Stage 4** – PAC-specific questions and a whimsical, customized endscreen.

## 🌿 Challenges Faced

### 🛠 Technical:
- **Storing user input** across multiple pages with `localStorage`
- Getting **button selections** to reflect correctly when clicked or toggled
- Styling buttons while preserving selected states
- Adding interactivity with **sliders and drag-and-drop interfaces**

### 💡 Conceptual:
- Finding a balance between **fun and reflection**
- Writing **questions that guide self-discovery** while still feeling conversational
- Designing a narrative that gently nudges users toward new experiences without judgment

## If I Had More Time...

If I had more time, I would love to:

- **Expand the bag-building interaction** with draggable objects, animated SVGs, and randomized surprise items
- 🗺 **Integrate Google Maps or local NYC art spots** for destination suggestions
- 📈 **Track anonymous data** (how people answer) to better understand club members
- Include **sketching prompts** based on the user’s answers and let the user draw on a little canvas at the end

## Final Thoughts

This project is a digital hug and encouragement to the **students who feel stuck**, and to the creative people who just need a little nudge to get back into making.
